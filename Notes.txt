# NPM - npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language maintained by npm, Inc., a subsidiary of GitHub. npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js and is included as a recommended feature in the Node.js installer.

# npm init - commnd for creting package.json

# It will sk for some detils & generte the package.json file.

# package.json - It's configurtion file for the JS project like Rect, ngulr, Vue & Node & NPM to manage packages & dependencies. Keeps an approx version of dependencies.


# Bundler - A JavaScript bundler is a tool that puts your code and all its dependencies together in one JavaScript file. There are many of them out there these days, being the most popular ones browserify and webpack, parcel, vite.


# There re two types of dependencies we cn install. 
1. Dev dependencies - It is generlly reuire in development phse.

2. Prod dependencies - It is norml dependency which moved to Production.


# npm install -D parcel - Instll for dev dependency only

# parcel - Its module bundler just like webpack & vite to combine ll the files & generte  single file for Production.

# caret(^) and tilde(~) in package.json

~version “Approximately equivalent to version”, will automatically update you to all future patch versions that are backwards-compatible, without incrementing the minor version. ~1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to < 1.3.0.

^version “Compatible with version”, will automatically update you to all future minor/patch versions that are backwards-compatible, without incrementing the major version. ^1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to < 2.0.0.

# package-lock.json - Keep the track of exact version of the dependencies. 

# integrity - integrity is basically a hash sha512. This hash is because to verify whatever is on my dev machine is matching the same version which is deployed on server.

# dependencies inside package-lock.json - 

# The package(parcel) has its own dependencies & its comes under this. & downloaded inside node_modules.

# node_modules = contains all the code that we fetched from NPM. It consists diffenent packages which reuired inside the project & its collection of dependencies.

# npx parcel index.html 

# npx is used for executing a package.

# CDN links is not a good way to include React into your project. Why? because fetching from CDN links is a costly operation. So, the better way to include it using NPM in your project.

Parcel is not doing everything by its own. Its dependent on the different packages.

browserslist - Its makes the website old browsers compatible. Its a npm package which is used by Parcel. You can configure it through composer.json file.


You can create the development run command through adding it into package.json scripts object.

Like start, build, jest.

& then run the command through npm run start or npm run build.


Conversion
#React.createElement => React Element JS Object => HTMLElement(render)

React.createElement - is not the HTML element its an object. When we render this to DOM then it becomes then it will become HTML.


root.render() - It will replace the content inside the root element not root append.

# JSX - JSX is a JS syntax which merges HTML & JS together.

JSX is not HTML inside JS. Its HTML or XML like syntax.

#JSX is a valid JS??

No - JSX is not a valid JS because JS is which is JS engine understands. & JS engine understands ECMAScript. If you just try to run it inside browser will throw syntax error.


Conversion
#JSX => React.createElement => React Element JS Object => HTMLElement(render)

Then how it is working? SO the module bundler like webpack & parcel transpiled the code into JS before sending to JS engine. & then JS engine is received the code what its understands.

Parcel is not doing directly this for you. Actually Babel is doing this transpilation.

Babel takes the JSX & convert it.

If you have to add attribute to JSX you need to use camelCase.

If you have to write the multiline jSX then you need to add it inside middle or round bracket. So, Babel will understands where it starting & ending.

// React Component

// Class based component - OLD

// Functional component - NEW

// React Functional component is just a JS function. Which returns some JSX element.


#Component composition
Component composition is a technique for building complex components from simpler ones.
In simpler words ccombining two or more components to building complex components is called
Component composition.

# JSX will sanitie the data before rendering to prevent Cross site scripts. 

# Difference between React Element & React Component??

While a React element is a plain object describing a part of the UI, a React component is a function or a class that can produce React elements and manage their state and lifecycle. Components can return multiple elements, components, strings, numbers, or any other types React can render.

#Props
Passing some data to the component is known as props. props is an object in receiving component. It's just a JS object.

#Config driven UI
Based on the config the UI should render. Suppose we need to show red color background at some location & green at other location.
